# WebRTC

This repository contains the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) source code used to
build the libraries used by [react-native-webrtc](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc).

For a given stable Chrome release (92 as an example) there will be 2 branches in this repository: M92-upstream and M92.

The former is an untouched branch off upstream, with the latter containing custom patches. All the patches we apply are
submitted upstream once testes, or abandoned.
